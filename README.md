# FC-DLL

An implementation of Fedi-To, for Windows 10 and later, which can be easily
built as a DLL.

This is useful for apps that want to support Fedi-To's protocols entirely on
the client. This implementation does NOT use the Fedi-To website, and is the
preferred way for non-web clients to support it. Websites (blogs, etc) should
still use the Fedi-To website, since they cannot use this implementation.
